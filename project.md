# DAO Blockchain Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This project implements a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) application using the Ignite Chain Development framework. The application facilitates task management, reward distribution, and balance tracking on the blockchain.

## Key Features
- Task Management System
  - Create new tasks
  - List available tasks
  - Get task details
- Balance Management
  - Query account balances
  - Track reward distributions
- Task Status Tracking
  - Monitor task completion status
  - Handle reward allocations

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Framework Selection: Ignite Chain
- **Decision**: Use Ignite Chain Development Framework
- **Rationale**:
  - Purpose-built for blockchain development
  - Provides scaffolding for Cosmos SDK based chains
  - Includes built-in CLI tools for chain management
  - Strong integration with Cosmos ecosystem

### 2. Network Architecture
- **Decision**: Connect to Know Freedom testnet
- **Details**: 
  - Node endpoint: 
  - Replaces local testnet for production-like environment
  - Enables real blockchain interactions vs mock server

### 3. Module Structure
- **Core Modules** (/x directory):
  - Task Management Module
  - Balance Module
  - Reward System Module
- **Supporting Components**:
  - API Layer (/api): Protocol buffers and gRPC definitions
  - Command Layer (/cmd): Entry points and CLI
  - Configuration (/config): Network and chain configs
  - Internal Libraries (/internal): Private application code
  - Package Libraries (/pkg): Shared utilities

### 4. Data Model Design
- Task Entity:
  - Unique identifiers
  - Status tracking
  - Reward allocation
  - Ownership information
- Balance System:
  - Account balance tracking
  - Reward distribution
  - Transaction history

### 5. Security Considerations
- Blockchain-native security through cryptographic signatures
- Role-based access control for task management
- Secure reward distribution mechanism
- Transaction validation and verification

### 6. Scalability Approach
- Modular architecture for easy feature addition
- Separate concerns between blockchain and application logic
- Efficient state management using Cosmos SDK
- Clear separation of read (queries) and write (transactions) operations

### 7. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual modules
- Integration tests for blockchain interactions
- End-to-end testing with testnet
- Dedicated test environment setup

## Development Setup
1. Install Ignite CLI
2. Clone the repository
3. Configure network settings to point to Know Freedom testnet
4. Install dependencies
5. Run local development environment

## Network Configuration
The application connects to the Know Freedom testnet for all blockchain operations:
- Network: Know Freedom Testnet
- Node Endpoint: https://node0.testnet.knowfreedom.io
- Chain ID: [To be filled based on testnet configuration]

## Contributing
